    "The body fat percentage (BFP) of a human or other living being is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. It is a measure of fitness level. While the body fat percentage plays an important role in various health outcomes such as life expectancy, prognosis for disease, healthcare costs, and the general well-being of individuals, it is quite difficult and costly to calculate: one of the more accurate methods requires underwater weighing. Thus, it is very practical to come up with a simple, accurate and precise method to estimate body fat percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use multiple regression to determine the prediction equations for the determination of body fat percentage. Since the data set contains various body measurements and an accurate estimate of the percentage of body fat from Siri's equation, body fat percentage can be fit to the other measurements using multiple regression, giving a useful predictive equation for doctor to estimate people's body fat percentage. The various measurements other than body fat  are ones that are easy to obtain and serve as proxies for body fat, which is not so easily obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set we used to analyze contains age, weight, height and 10 circumference measurements on 252 men. Each man's percentage of body fat was accurately estimated by an underwater weighing technique."

    "Firstly, we look through the summary statistics of all variables. We found that there are some abnormal observations. The body fat of observation 182 is 0 which must be an error and this could be handled by computing from the Siri's formula, which should be -3.6. Since there may exist an record error, we decide to delete it. The density of observation 216 is 0.995 smaller than the density of water. Since we do not use density and the other features are normal, we just keep this observation. The height of observation 42 is 29.50 which is so small, but the other features seem quite normal. We consider to impute it by BMI calculation, which should be 69.50. \n",

    "Secondly, we fit the linear regression with all observations and then use Cook‚Äôs distance to find the influential points of the model.
